# Default variables and values for this role.
#
# These variables are designed to be easily overridden (as they have a low
# precedence) and typically allow users to customize the role's behavior.
# Each variable should have a clear comment above it, describing its purpose
# and how it fits into the role's functionality.

---

# Determines whether the managed resources should be `present` or `absent`.
#
# `present` ensures that required components, such as software packages, are
# installed and configured.
#
# `absent` reverts changes as much as possible, such as removing packages,
# deleting created users, stopping services, restoring modified settings, …
#
# - Type: str
# - Required: No
# - Default: present
# - Choices: present, absent
run_fail2ban_state: "present"


# If set to `true`, all managed packages will be upgraded during each Ansible
# run (e.g., when the package provider detects a newer version than the
# currently installed one).
#
# - Type: bool
# - Required: No
# - Default: false
run_fail2ban_autoupgrade: false


# Defines the status of the service(s).
#
# `enabled`: Service is running and will start automatically at boot.
#
# `disabled`: Service is stopped and will not start automatically at boot.
#
# `running` Service is running but will not start automatically at boot. This
# can be used to start a service on the first Ansible run without enabling it
# for boot.
#
# `unmanaged`: Service will not start at boot, and Ansible will not manage its
# running state. This is primarily useful when services are monitored and
# managed by systems other than Ansible.
#
# The singular form (`service`) is used for simplicity. However, the defined
# status applies to all services if multiple are being managed by this role.
#
# - Type: str
# - Required: No

run_fail2ban_service_state: "enabled"

# Fail2ban service configuration values.
#
# These settings are placed in a drop-in configuration file in `<config
# dir>/fail2ban.d`. They take highest priority, overriding internal defaults
# (see `__run_fail2ban_service_settings_defaults` in `vars/main.yml`) and
# platform-specific overrides.
#
# Use standard Fail2ban section names as top-level YAML keys, and place their
# corresponding option names and values inside each section. This YAML structure
# is directly translated into Fail2ban's INI format, preserving section names
# and option names exactly as written:
#
# - Each INI section (`[SECTION]`) becomes a YAML mapping key.
# - Each INI option inside that section becomes a YAML key-value pair.
#
# Special cases:
#
# - For boolean values, use `true`/`false` (these will be converted to strings
#   by the role as needed).
# - For multiline values, use normal YAML block scalars (`|`). The role will
#   automatically handle indentation:
#   ```
#   logpath: |
#     /var/log/auth.log
#     /var/log/secure
#   ```
# - Settings in Fail2ban's `DEFAULT` section are getting applied to all parts of
#   the configuration unless overridden in individual section definitions.
#
# Example:
#
# ```yaml
# DEFAULT:
#   loglevel: "INFO"
#   logtarget: "/var/log/fail2ban.log"
# Thread:
#   stacksize: 0
# ```
#
# will result in
